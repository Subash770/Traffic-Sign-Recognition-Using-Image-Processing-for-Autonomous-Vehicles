# Traffic Sign Recognition Using Image Processing for Autonomous Vehicles

This project focuses on creating a system that can detect and recognize traffic signs using image processing techniques, leveraging **GoogleNet** for deep learning-based image classification. The system is designed to aid autonomous vehicles by helping them recognize traffic signs in real-time from images or video input.

## Project Overview

The system utilizes **GoogleNet**, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, to classify traffic signs based on pre-trained models. It is optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time autonomous driving applications.

### Key Features:
- **Traffic Sign Classification**: Detects and classifies various traffic signs like stop signs, yield signs, and speed limits.
- **GoogleNet**: A pre-trained deep learning model used for image classification tasks.
- **Image Processing Techniques**: Enhances image data for better feature extraction and recognition.
